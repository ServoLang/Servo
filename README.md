# Servo Programming Language

**Servo** is a high-level, object-oriented programming language designed for modern software development. With an emphasis on simplicity, scalability, and efficiency, Servo offers robust features to empower developers to write clean, maintainable, and performant code. Servo is versatile, supporting applications ranging from web development to complex system architectures.

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Design**: Full support for encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Strong Typing with Flexibility**: Combines static typing for safety and dynamic capabilities where needed.
- **Memory Safety**: Servo includes built-in safeguards against memory leaks and null-pointer dereferencing.
- **Concurrency Made Easy**: First-class support for concurrent programming with lightweight threads and asynchronous operations.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Write code once and deploy it anywhere.
- **Modern Syntax**: Inspired by popular languages like Python, Swift, and Kotlin, with an emphasis on readability and developer productivity.
- **Built-In Testing Framework**: Integrated tools for writing, running, and debugging unit tests.
- **Extensible Libraries**: A rich standard library and support for third-party package integrations.

## Example Code

Hereâ€™s a quick example of Servoâ€™s syntax:

```servo
// A simple "Hello, World!" program in Servo
class Greeter {
    // Property
    let greeting: String

    // Constructor
    init(message: String) {
        self.greeting = message
    }

    // Method
    func sayHello() {
        print(greeting)
    }
}

// Create an instance of Greeter
let greeter = Greeter(message: "Hello, World!")
greeter.sayHello()
```

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Download the latest version of Servo from the [official website](https://example.com/servo).
2. Install the CLI using the installer for your platform.
3. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   servo --version
   ```

### Writing Your First Program

1. Create a new Servo file:
   ```bash
   touch main.svo
   ```
2. Add your code to `main.svo`.
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   servo run main.svo
   ```

## Language Basics

### Variables and Types

Servo supports both type inference and explicit type declarations:

```servo
let inferredVar = 42      // Type inferred as Int
let explicitVar: String = "Hello"
```

### Classes and Objects

Servo uses a clean and modern approach to object-oriented programming:

```servo
class Animal {
    let name: String

    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }

    func speak() {
        print("\(name) makes a sound.")
    }
}

let dog = Animal(name: "Dog")
dog.speak()
```

### Asynchronous Programming

Servo makes asynchronous operations intuitive:

```servo
async func fetchData() -> String {
    await delay(2) // Simulates a delay of 2 seconds
    return "Data fetched!"
}

let data = await fetchData()
print(data)
```
